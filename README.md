## Introduction

So here you have it... my personal website archive! This is a project that demonstrates my abilities and passion using the latest tech stack. It was to be as straightforward and effective as possible in design, with a focus on performance and ease of use.


### Why this tech stack?

I wanted to try Vite and PostCSS but build something that’s easy to update and running optimally. My goal is to improve my JavaScript skills and other technologies through this simple and efficient way.

## Features

- **Dynamic Content:** The portfolio is almost fully dynamic, everything is pulled from Firebase Realtime Database. It’s very easy to update and scale.
- **Theming:** Script for creating custom theme from a single color, easy to change instantly.

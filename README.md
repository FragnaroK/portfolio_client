### Why this tech stack?

I choose this tech stack mostly because I wanted to try Vite and PostCSS. Also, I tried to make it as simple on design and functionality as possible so eventually I could create a vanilla JS version to try to achieve the same or better performance and loading times. In summary, because I wanted to improve my skills in vanilla JS and other tech I am interested in.
